## Scripts

The database was generated by web scraping the MacEwan website and using python libraries such as faker. We have scraped all of the courses available at MacEwan (~3000) and all of the instructors in the 'Our People' sections. There are over 20,000 students in the database and have generated randomized semester data dating back 30 years. All of these scripts (as well as some to perform other tasks such as batching very large sql queries like the sections one) can be found in the `database > scripts` folder along with some raw data extracted/appended and queries to populate the database.
